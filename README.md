## What is included: Coroutines, Hilt, Modern Architecture Components, UDF, Room, Material Components, Accompanist Lib and more.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Ensuring a consistent and predictable behavior.
* **MVI Pattern:** A robust pattern that simplifies user interactions and data updates.
* **Domain Layer**: An optional layer that encapsulates all the business logic, making the app robust and efficient, making the app's core functions clear and concise.
The UI is done with simplicity, in the Neobrutalism style, as the focus and the emphasis are placed on robust and clean project architecture.
